Text data must be processed and transformed to a numeric representation to be ready for computation in modeling; in tidymodels, we use a recipe for this preprocessing. This article also shows how to extract information from each model fit during tuning to use later on.\n\n\n## Text as data\n\nThe text data we'll use in this article are from Amazon: \n\n> This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review.\n\nThis article uses a small subset of the total reviews [available at the original source](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html). We sampled a single review from 5,000 random products and allocated 80% of these data to the training set, with the remaining 1,000 reviews held out for the test set.   \n\nThere is a column for the product, a column for the text of the review, and a factor column for the outcome variable. The outcome is whether the reviewer gave the product a five-star rating or not.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"data\"\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\ndata(\"small_fine_foods\")\ntraining_data\n```\n\nOur modeling goal is to create modeling features from the text of the reviews to predict whether the review was five-star or not.\n\n## Inputs for the search\n\nText, perhaps more so than tabular data we often deal with, must be heavily processed to be used as predictor data for modeling. There are multiple ways to process and prepare text for modeling; let's add several steps together to create different kinds of features:\n\n* Create an initial set of count-based features, such as the number of words, spaces, lower- or uppercase characters, URLs, and so on; we can use the [textfeatures](https://github.com/mkearney/textfeatures) package for this.\n\n* [Tokenize](https://smltar.com/tokenization.html) the text (i.e. break the text into smaller components such as words).\n\n* Remove stop words such as \"the\", \"an\", \"of\", etc.\n\n* [Stem](https://smltar.com/stemming.html) tokens to a common root where possible.\n\n* Convert tokens to dummy variables via a [signed, binary hash function](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/encoding-predictors-with-many-categories.html).\n\n* Optionally transform non-token features (the count-based features like number of lowercase characters) to a more symmetric state using a [Yeo-Johnson transformation](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/numeric-one-to-one.html).\n\n* Remove predictors with a single distinct value.\n\n* Center and scale all predictors. \n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n We will end up with two kinds of features:\n\n- dummy/indicator variables for the count-based features like number of digits or punctuation characters \n- hash features for the tokens like \"salsa\" or \"delicious\". \n:::\n\nSome of these preprocessing steps (such as stemming) may or may not be good ideas but a full discussion of their effects is beyond the scope of this article. In this preprocessing approach, the main tuning parameter is the number of hashing features to use. \n\nBefore we start building our preprocessing recipe, we need some helper objects. For example, for the Yeo-Johnson transformation, we need to know the set of count-based text features: \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"feat-list\"\nlibrary(textfeatures)\n\nbasics <- names(textfeatures:::count_functions)\nhead(basics)\n```\n\nAlso, the implementation of feature hashes does not produce the binary values we need. This small function will help convert the scores to values of -1, 0, or 1:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"hash-func\"\nbinary_hash <- function(x) {\n  x <- ifelse(x < 0, -1, x)\n  x <- ifelse(x > 0,  1, x)\n  x\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's put this all together in one recipe:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"text-rec\"\nlibrary(textrecipes)\n\npre_proc <-\n  recipe(score ~ product + review, data = training_data) %>%\n  # Do not use the product ID as a predictor\n  update_role(product, new_role = \"id\") %>%\n  # Make a copy of the raw text\n  step_mutate(review_raw = review) %>%\n  # Compute the initial features. This removes the `review_raw` column\n  step_textfeature(review_raw) %>%\n  # Make the feature names shorter\n  step_rename_at(\n    starts_with(\"textfeature_\"),\n    fn = ~ gsub(\"textfeature_review_raw_\", \"\", .)\n  ) %>%\n  step_tokenize(review)  %>%\n  step_stopwords(review) %>%\n  step_stem(review) %>%\n  # Here is where the tuning parameter is declared\n  step_texthash(review, signed = TRUE, num_terms = tune()) %>%\n  # Simplify these names\n  step_rename_at(starts_with(\"review_hash\"), fn = ~ gsub(\"review_\", \"\", .)) %>%\n  # Convert the features from counts to values of -1, 0, or 1\n  step_mutate_at(starts_with(\"hash\"), fn = binary_hash) %>%\n  # Transform the initial feature set\n  step_YeoJohnson(one_of(!!basics)) %>%\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%\n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\n```\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n Note that, when objects from the global environment are used, they are injected into the step objects via `!!`. For some parallel processing technologies, these objects may not be found by the worker processes. \n:::\n\nThe preprocessing recipe is long and complex (often typical for working with text data) but the model we'll use is more straightforward. Let's stick with a regularized logistic regression model: \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"lr\"\nlr_mod <-\n  logistic_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>%\n  set_engine(\"glmnet\")\n```\n\nThere are three tuning parameters for this data analysis:\n\n- `num_terms`, the number of feature hash variables to create\n- `penalty`, the amount of regularization for the model\n- `mixture`, the proportion of L1 regularization\n\n## Resampling\n\nThere are enough data here so that 10-fold resampling would hold out 400 reviews at a time to estimate performance. Performance estimates using this many observations have sufficiently low noise to measure and tune models.  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"folds\"\nset.seed(8935)\nfolds <- vfold_cv(training_data)\nfolds\n```\n\n## Grid search\n\nLet's begin our tuning with [grid search](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/work/tune-svm/) and a regular grid. For glmnet models, evaluating penalty values is fairly cheap because of the use of the [\"submodel-trick\"](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/extras/optimizations.html#sub-model-speed-ups-1). The grid will use 20 penalty values, 5 mixture values, and 3 values for the number of hash features.  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"grid\"\nfive_star_grid <- \n  crossing(\n    penalty = 10^seq(-3, 0, length = 20),\n    mixture = c(0.01, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1),\n    num_terms = 2^c(8, 10, 12)\n  )\nfive_star_grid\n```\n\nNote that, for each resample, the (computationally expensive) text preprocessing recipe is only prepped 6 times. This increases the efficiency of the analysis by avoiding redundant work. \n\nLet's save information on the number of predictors by penalty value for each glmnet model. This can help us understand how many features were used across the penalty values. Use an extraction function to do this:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"extract\"\nglmnet_vars <- function(x) {\n  # `x` will be a workflow object\n  mod <- extract_model(x)\n  # `df` is the number of model terms for each penalty value\n  tibble(penalty = mod$lambda, num_vars = mod$df)\n}\n\nctrl <- control_grid(extract = glmnet_vars, verbose = TRUE)\n```\n\nFinally, let's run the grid search:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"grid-search\"\n#| message: false\nroc_scores <- metric_set(roc_auc)\n\nset.seed(1559)\nfive_star_glmnet <- \n  tune_grid(\n    lr_mod, \n    pre_proc, \n    resamples = folds, \n    grid = five_star_grid, \n    metrics = roc_scores, \n    control = ctrl\n  )\n\nfive_star_glmnet\n```\n\nThis took a while to complete! What do the results look like? Let's get the resampling estimates of the area under the ROC curve for each tuning parameter:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"grid-roc\"\ngrid_roc <- \n  collect_metrics(five_star_glmnet) %>% \n  arrange(desc(mean))\ngrid_roc\n```\n\nThe best results have a fairly high penalty value and focus on the ridge penalty (i.e. no feature selection via the lasso's L1 penalty). The best solutions also use the largest number of hashing features. \n\nWhat is the relationship between performance and the tuning parameters? \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"grid-plot\"\n#| fig-width:  10\nautoplot(five_star_glmnet, metric = \"roc_auc\")\n```\n\n- We can definitely see that performance improves with the number of features included. In this article, we've used a small sample of the overall data set available. When more data are used, an even larger feature set is optimal. \n\n- The profiles with larger mixture values (greater than 0.01) have steep drop-offs in performance. What's that about? Those are cases where the lasso penalty is removing too many (and perhaps all) features from the model.  \n- The panel with at least 4096 features shows that there are several parameter combinations that have about the same performance; there isn't much difference between the best performance for the different mixture values. A case could be made that we should choose a _larger_ mixture value and a _smaller_ penalty to select a simpler model that contains fewer predictors. \n\n- If more experimentation were conducted, a larger set of features (more than 4096) should also be considered.  \n\nWe'll come back to the extracted glmnet components at the end of this article. \n\n## Directed search\n\nWhat if we had started with Bayesian optimization? Would a good set of conditions have been found more efficiently? \n\nLet's pretend that we haven't seen the grid search results. We'll initialize the Gaussian process model with five tuning parameter combinations chosen with a space-filling design. \n\nIt might be good to use a custom `dials` object for the number of hash terms. The default object, `num_terms()`, uses a linear range and tries to set the upper bound of the parameter using the data. Instead, let's create a parameter set, change the scale to be `log2`, and define the same range as was used in grid search. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"hash-range\"\nhash_range <- num_terms(c(8, 12), trans = log2_trans())\nhash_range\n```\n\nTo use this, we have to merge the recipe and `parsnip` model object into a workflow:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"wflow\"\nfive_star_wflow <-\n  workflow() %>%\n  add_recipe(pre_proc) %>%\n  add_model(lr_mod)\n```\n\nThen we can extract and manipulate the corresponding parameter set:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"search-set\"\nfive_star_set <-\n  five_star_wflow %>%\n  parameters() %>%\n  update(\n    num_terms = hash_range, \n    penalty = penalty(c(-3, 0)),\n    mixture = mixture(c(0.05, 1.00))\n  )\n```\n\nThis is passed to the search function via the `param_info` argument. \n\nThe initial rounds of search can be biased more towards exploration of the parameter space (as opposed to staying near the current best results). If expected improvement is used as the acquisition function, the trade-off value can be slowly moved from exploration to exploitation over iterations (see the tune vignette on [acquisition functions](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/acquisition_functions.html) for more details). The tune package has a built-in function called `expo_decay()` that can help accomplish this:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"decay\"\ntrade_off_decay <- function(iter) {\n  expo_decay(iter, start_val = .01, limit_val = 0, slope = 1/4)\n}\n```\n\nUsing these values, let's run the search:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"search\"\nset.seed(12)\nfive_star_search <-\n  tune_bayes(\n    five_star_wflow, \n    resamples = folds,\n    param_info = five_star_set,\n    initial = 5,\n    iter = 30,\n    metrics = roc_scores,\n    objective = exp_improve(trade_off_decay),\n    control = control_bayes(verbose_iter = TRUE)\n  )\n\nfive_star_search\n```\n\nThese results show some improvement over the initial set. One issue is that so many settings are sub-optimal (as shown in the plot above for grid search) so there are poor results periodically. There are regions where the penalty parameter becomes too large and all of the predictors are removed from the model. These regions are also dependent on the number of terms. There is a fairly narrow ridge (sorry, pun intended!) where good performance can be achieved. Using more iterations would probably result in the search finding better results. \nLet's look at a plot of model performance versus the search iterations:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"iter-plot\"\nautoplot(five_star_search, type = \"performance\")\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nWhat would we do if we knew about the grid search results and wanted to try directed, iterative search? We would restrict the range for the number of hash features to be larger (especially with more data). We might also restrict the penalty and mixture parameters to have a lower upper bound. \n:::\n\n## Extracted results\n\nLet's return to the grid search results and examine the results of our `extract` function. For each _fitted model_, a tibble was saved that contains the relationship between the number of predictors and the penalty value. Let's look at these results for the best model:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"best-res\"\nparams <- select_best(five_star_glmnet, metric = \"roc_auc\")\nparams\n```\n\nRecall that we saved the glmnet results in a tibble. The column `five_star_glmnet$.extracts` is a list of tibbles. As an example, the first element of the list is:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"first-elem\"\nfive_star_glmnet$.extracts[[1]]\n```\n\nMore nested tibbles! Let's `unnest()` the `five_star_glmnet$.extracts` column:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"unnest\"\nlibrary(tidyr)\nextracted <- \n  five_star_glmnet %>% \n  dplyr::select(id, .extracts) %>% \n  unnest(cols = .extracts)\nextracted\n```\n\nOne thing to realize here is that `tune_grid()` [may not fit all of the models](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/extras/optimizations.html) that are evaluated. In this case, for each value of `mixture` and `num_terms`, the model is fit over _all_ penalty values (this is a feature of this particular model and is not generally true for other engines). To select the best parameter set, we can exclude the `penalty` column in `extracted`:\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"select-best\"\nextracted <- \n  extracted %>% \n  dplyr::select(-penalty) %>% \n  inner_join(params, by = c(\"num_terms\", \"mixture\")) %>% \n  # Now remove it from the final results\n  dplyr::select(-penalty)\nextracted\n```\n\nNow we can get at the results that we want using another `unnest()`:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"final-unnest\"\nextracted <- \n  extracted %>% \n  unnest(col = .extracts) # <- these contain a `penalty` column\nextracted\n```\n\nLet's look at a plot of these results (per resample):\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"var-plot\"\nggplot(extracted, aes(x = penalty, y = num_vars)) + \n  geom_line(aes(group = id, col = id), alpha = .5) + \n  ylab(\"Number of retained predictors\") + \n  scale_x_log10()  + \n  ggtitle(paste(\"mixture = \", params$mixture, \"and\", params$num_terms, \"features\")) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\nThese results might help guide the choice of the `penalty` range if more optimization was conducted. \n\n## Session information {#session-info}\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"si\"\n#| echo: false\nsmall_session(pkgs)\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"setup\"\n#| include: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nsource(here::here(\"common.R\"))\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"load\"\n#| include: false\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(stopwords)\nlibrary(doMC)\nregisterDoMC(cores = parallel::detectCores())\n\npkgs <- c(\"tidymodels\", \"textrecipes\", \"textfeatures\", \"stopwords\")\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n```\n\n## Introduction\n\n`r article_req_pkgs(pkgs)`\n\nThis article demonstrates an advanced example for training and tuning models for text data.

Instead, let's create a parameter set, change the scale to be `log2`, and define the same range as was used in grid search. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"hash-range\"\nhash_range <- num_terms(c(8, 12), trans = log2_trans())\nhash_range\n```\n\nTo use this, we have to merge the recipe and `parsnip` model object into a workflow:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"wflow\"\nfive_star_wflow <-\n  workflow() %>%\n  add_recipe(pre_proc) %>%\n  add_model(lr_mod)\n```\n\nThen we can extract and manipulate the corresponding parameter set:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"search-set\"\nfive_star_set <-\n  five_star_wflow %>%\n  parameters() %>%\n  update(\n    num_terms = hash_range, \n    penalty = penalty(c(-3, 0)),\n    mixture = mixture(c(0.05, 1.00))\n  )\n```\n\nThis is passed to the search function via the `param_info` argument. \n\nThe initial rounds of search can be biased more towards exploration of the parameter space (as opposed to staying near the current best results). If expected improvement is used as the acquisition function, the trade-off value can be slowly moved from exploration to exploitation over iterations (see the tune vignette on [acquisition functions](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/acquisition_functions.html) for more details). The tune package has a built-in function called `expo_decay()` that can help accomplish this:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"decay\"\ntrade_off_decay <- function(iter) {\n  expo_decay(iter, start_val = .01, limit_val = 0, slope = 1/4)\n}\n```\n\nUsing these values, let's run the search:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"search\"\nset.seed(12)\nfive_star_search <-\n  tune_bayes(\n    five_star_wflow, \n    resamples = folds,\n    param_info = five_star_set,\n    initial = 5,\n    iter = 30,\n    metrics = roc_scores,\n    objective = exp_improve(trade_off_decay),\n    control = control_bayes(verbose_iter = TRUE)\n  )\n\nfive_star_search\n```\n\nThese results show some improvement over the initial set. One issue is that so many settings are sub-optimal (as shown in the plot above for grid search) so there are poor results periodically. There are regions where the penalty parameter becomes too large and all of the predictors are removed from the model. These regions are also dependent on the number of terms. There is a fairly narrow ridge (sorry, pun intended!) where good performance can be achieved. Using more iterations would probably result in the search finding better results. \nLet's look at a plot of model performance versus the search iterations:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"iter-plot\"\nautoplot(five_star_search, type = \"performance\")\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nWhat would we do if we knew about the grid search results and wanted to try directed, iterative search? We would restrict the range for the number of hash features to be larger (especially with more data). We might also restrict the penalty and mixture parameters to have a lower upper bound. \n:::\n\n## Extracted results\n\nLet's return to the grid search results and examine the results of our `extract` function. For each _fitted model_, a tibble was saved that contains the relationship between the number of predictors and the penalty value. Let's look at these results for the best model:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"best-res\"\nparams <- select_best(five_star_glmnet, metric = \"roc_auc\")\nparams\n```\n\nRecall that we saved the glmnet results in a tibble. The column `five_star_glmnet$.extracts` is a list of tibbles. As an example, the first element of the list is:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"first-elem\"\nfive_star_glmnet$.extracts[[1]]\n```\n\nMore nested tibbles! Let's `unnest()` the `five_star_glmnet$.extracts` column:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"unnest\"\nlibrary(tidyr)\nextracted <- \n  five_star_glmnet %>% \n  dplyr::select(id, .extracts) %>% \n  unnest(cols = .extracts)\nextracted\n```\n\nOne thing to realize here is that `tune_grid()` [may not fit all of the models](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/extras/optimizations.html) that are evaluated. In this case, for each value of `mixture` and `num_terms`, the model is fit over _all_ penalty values (this is a feature of this particular model and is not generally true for other engines). To select the best parameter set, we can exclude the `penalty` column in `extracted`:\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"select-best\"\nextracted <- \n  extracted %>% \n  dplyr::select(-penalty) %>% \n  inner_join(params, by = c(\"num_terms\", \"mixture\")) %>% \n  # Now remove it from the final results\n  dplyr::select(-penalty)\nextracted\n```\n\nNow we can get at the results that we want using another `unnest()`:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"final-unnest\"\nextracted <- \n  extracted %>% \n  unnest(col = .extracts) # <- these contain a `penalty` column\nextracted\n```\n\nLet's look at a plot of these results (per resample):\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"var-plot\"\nggplot(extracted, aes(x = penalty, y = num_vars)) + \n  geom_line(aes(group = id, col = id), alpha = .5) + \n  ylab(\"Number of retained predictors\") + \n  scale_x_log10()  + \n  ggtitle(paste(\"mixture = \", params$mixture, \"and\", params$num_terms, \"features\")) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\nThese results might help guide the choice of the `penalty` range if more optimization was conducted. \n\n## Session information {#session-info}\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"si\"\n#| echo:
