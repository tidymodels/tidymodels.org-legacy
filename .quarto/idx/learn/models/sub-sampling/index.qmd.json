In such a situation (without compensating for it), most models will overfit to the majority class and produce very good statistics for the class containing the frequently occurring classes while the minority classes have poor performance. \n\nThis article describes subsampling for dealing with class imbalances. For better understanding, some knowledge of classification metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curves is required. See Section 3.2.2 in [Kuhn and Johnson (2019)](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/measuring-performance.html) for more information on these metrics.  \n\n## Simulated data\n\nConsider a two-class problem where the first class has a very low rate of occurrence. The data were simulated and can be imported into R using the code below:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"load-data\"\n#| message: false\nimbal_data <- \n  readr::read_csv(\"https://bit.ly/imbal_data\") %>% \n  mutate(Class = factor(Class))\ndim(imbal_data)\ntable(imbal_data$Class)\n```\n\nIf \"Class1\" is the event of interest, it is very likely that a classification model would be able to achieve very good _specificity_ since almost all of the data are of the second class. _Sensitivity_, however, would likely be poor since the models will optimize accuracy (or other loss functions) by predicting everything to be the majority class. \n\nOne result of class imbalance when there are two classes is that the default probability cutoff of 50% is inappropriate; a different cutoff that is more extreme might be able to achieve good performance. \n\n## Subsampling the data\n\nOne way to alleviate this issue is to _subsample_ the data. There are a number of ways to do this but the most simple one is to _sample down_ (undersample) the majority class data until it occurs with the same frequency as the minority class. While it may seem counterintuitive, throwing out a large percentage of your data can be effective at producing a useful model that can recognize both the majority and minority classes. In some cases, this even means that the overall performance of the model is better (e.g. improved area under the ROC curve). However, subsampling almost always produces models that are _better calibrated_, meaning that the distributions of the class probabilities are more well behaved. As a result, the default 50% cutoff is much more likely to produce better sensitivity and specificity values than they would otherwise. \n\nLet's explore subsampling using `themis::step_rose()` in a recipe for the simulated data. It uses the ROSE (random over sampling examples) method from [Menardi, G. and Torelli, N. (2014)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22training+and+assessing+classification+rules+with+imbalanced+data%22). This is an example of an oversampling strategy, rather than undersampling.\n\nIn terms of workflow:\n\n * It is extremely important that subsampling occurs _inside of resampling_. Otherwise, the resampling process can produce [poor estimates of model performance](https://topepo.github.io/caret/subsampling-for-class-imbalances.html#resampling). \n * The subsampling process should only be applied to the analysis set. The assessment set should reflect the event rates seen \"in the wild\" and, for this reason, the `skip` argument to `step_downsample()` and other subsampling recipes steps has a default of `TRUE`. \n\nHere is a simple recipe implementing oversampling: \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"rec\"\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(themis)\nimbal_rec <- \n  recipe(Class ~ ., data = imbal_data) %>%\n  step_rose(Class)\n```\n\nFor a model, let's use a [quadratic discriminant analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_classifier#Quadratic_discriminant_analysis) (QDA) model. From the discrim package, this model can be specified using:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"qda\"\nlibrary(discrim)\nqda_mod <- \n  discrim_regularized(frac_common_cov = 0, frac_identity = 0) %>% \n  set_engine(\"klaR\")\n```\n\nTo keep these objects bound together, they can be combined in a [workflow](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/):\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"wflw\"\nqda_rose_wflw <- \n  workflow() %>% \n  add_model(qda_mod) %>% \n  add_recipe(imbal_rec)\nqda_rose_wflw\n```\n\n## Model performance\n\nStratified, repeated 10-fold cross-validation is used to resample the model:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"cv\"\nset.seed(5732)\ncv_folds <- vfold_cv(imbal_data, strata = \"Class\", repeats = 5)\n```\n\nTo measure model performance, let's use two metrics:\n\n * The area under the [ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) is an overall assessment of performance across _all_ cutoffs. Values near one indicate very good results while values near 0.5 would imply that the model is very poor. \n * The _J_ index (a.k.a. [Youden's _J_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youden%27s_J_statistic) statistic) is `sensitivity + specificity - 1`. Values near one are once again best. \n\nIf a model is poorly calibrated, the ROC curve value might not show diminished performance. However, the _J_ index would be lower for models with pathological distributions for the class probabilities. The yardstick package will be used to compute these metrics. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"metrics\"\ncls_metrics <- metric_set(roc_auc, j_index)\n```\n\nNow, we train the models and generate the results using `tune::fit_resamples()`:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"resample-rose\"\n#| message: false\nset.seed(2180)\nqda_rose_res <- fit_resamples(\n  qda_rose_wflw, \n  resamples = cv_folds, \n  metrics = cls_metrics\n)\n\ncollect_metrics(qda_rose_res)\n```\n\nWhat do the results look like without using ROSE? We can create another workflow and fit the QDA model along the same resamples:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"qda-only\"\nqda_wflw <- \n  workflow() %>% \n  add_model(qda_mod) %>% \n  add_formula(Class ~ .)\n\nset.seed(2180)\nqda_only_res <- fit_resamples(qda_wflw, resamples = cv_folds, metrics = cls_metrics)\ncollect_metrics(qda_only_res)\n```\n\nIt looks like ROSE helped a lot, especially with the J-index. Class imbalance sampling methods tend to greatly improve metrics based on the hard class predictions (i.e., the categorical predictions) because the default cutoff tends to be a better balance of sensitivity and specificity. \n\nLet's plot the metrics for each resample to see how the individual results changed. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"merge-metrics\"\nno_sampling <- \n  qda_only_res %>% \n  collect_metrics(summarize = FALSE) %>% \n  dplyr::select(-.estimator) %>% \n  mutate(sampling = \"no_sampling\")\n\nwith_sampling <- \n  qda_rose_res %>% \n  collect_metrics(summarize = FALSE) %>% \n  dplyr::select(-.estimator) %>% \n  mutate(sampling = \"rose\")\n\nbind_rows(no_sampling, with_sampling) %>% \n  mutate(label = paste(id2, id)) %>%  \n  ggplot(aes(x = sampling, y = .estimate, group = label)) + \n  geom_line(alpha = .4) + \n  facet_wrap(~ .metric, scales = \"free_y\")\n```\n\nThis visually demonstrates that the subsampling mostly affects metrics that use the hard class predictions. \n\n## Session information {#session-info}\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"si\"\n#| echo: false\nsmall_session(pkgs)\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"setup\"\n#| include: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nsource(here::here(\"common.R\"))\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| label: \"load\"\n#| include: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(klaR)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(discrim)\nlibrary(themis)\nlibrary(ROSE)\n\npkgs <- c(\"tidymodels\", \"klaR\", \"themis\", \"discrim\", \"readr\", \"ROSE\")\n\ntheme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"top\"))\n```\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n`r article_req_pkgs(pkgs)`\n\nSubsampling a training set, either undersampling or oversampling the appropriate class or classes, can be a helpful approach to dealing with classification data where one or more classes occur very infrequently.
