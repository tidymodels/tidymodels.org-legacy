## Introduction

`r article_req_pkgs(pkgs)`

Many of the examples for model tuning focus on [grid search](/learn/work/tune-svm/). For that method, all the candidate tuning parameter combinations are defined prior to evaluation. Alternatively, _iterative search_ can be used to analyze the existing tuning parameter results and then _predict_ which tuning parameters to try next. 

There are a variety of methods for iterative search and the focus in this article is on _Bayesian optimization_. For more information on this method, these resources might be helpful:

## Cell segmenting revisited

To demonstrate this approach to tuning models, let's return to the cell segmentation data from the [Getting Started](/start/resampling/) article on resampling: 

```{r}
#| label: "import-data"
library(tidymodels)
library(modeldata)

# Load data
data(cells)

set.seed(2369)
tr_te_split <- initial_split(cells %>% select(-case), prop = 3/4)
cell_train <- training(tr_te_split)
cell_test  <- testing(tr_te_split)

set.seed(1697)
folds <- vfold_cv(cell_train, v = 10)
```

## The tuning scheme

Since the predictors are highly correlated, we can used a recipe to convert the original predictors to principal component scores. There is also slight class imbalance in these data; about `r floor(mean(cells$class == "PS") * 100)`% of the data are poorly segmented. To mitigate this, the data will be down-sampled at the end of the pre-processing so that the number of poorly and well segmented cells occur with equal frequency. We can use a recipe for all this pre-processing, but the number of principal components will need to be _tuned_ so that we have enough (but not too many) representations of the data. 

```{r}
#| label: "recipe"
library(themis)

cell_pre_proc <-
  recipe(class ~ ., data = cell_train) %>%
  step_YeoJohnson(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_pca(all_predictors(), num_comp = tune()) %>%
  step_downsample(class)
```

In this analysis, we will use a support vector machine to model the data. Let's use a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and tune its main parameter ($\sigma$). Additionally, the main SVM parameter, the cost value, also needs optimization. 

```{r}
#| label: "model"
svm_mod <-
  svm_rbf(mode = "classification", cost = tune(), rbf_sigma = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("kernlab")
```

These two objects (the recipe and model) will be combined into a single object via the `workflow()` function from the [workflows](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/) package; this object will be used in the optimization process. 

```{r}
#| label: "workflow"
svm_wflow <-
  workflow() %>%
  add_model(svm_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(cell_pre_proc)
```

From this object, we can derive information about what parameters are slated to be tuned. A parameter set is derived by: 

```{r}
#| label: "pset"
svm_set <- extract_parameter_set_dials(svm_wflow)
svm_set
```

The default range for the number of PCA components is rather small for this data set. A member of the parameter set can be modified using the `update()` function. Let's constrain the search to one to twenty components by updating the `num_comp` parameter. Additionally, the lower bound of this parameter is set to zero which specifies that the original predictor set should also be evaluated (i.e., with no PCA step at all): 

```{r}
#| label: "update"
svm_set <- 
  svm_set %>% 
  update(num_comp = num_comp(c(0L, 20L)))
```

## Sequential tuning 

Bayesian optimization is a sequential method that uses a model to predict new candidate parameters for assessment. When scoring potential parameter value, the mean and variance of performance are predicted. The strategy used to define how these two statistical quantities are used is defined by an _acquisition function_. 

For example, one approach for scoring new candidates is to use a confidence bound. Suppose accuracy is being optimized. For a metric that we want to maximize, a lower confidence bound can be used. The multiplier on the standard error (denoted as $\kappa$) is a value that can be used to make trade-offs between **exploration** and **exploitation**. 

 * **Exploration** means that the search will consider candidates in untested space.

 * **Exploitation** focuses in areas where the previous best results occurred. 

The variance predicted by the Bayesian model is mostly spatial variation; the value will be large for candidate values that are not close to values that have already been evaluated. If the standard error multiplier is high, the search process will be more likely to avoid areas without candidate values in the vicinity. 

We'll use another acquisition function, _expected improvement_, that determines which candidates are likely to be helpful relative to the current best results. This is the default acquisition function. More information on these functions can be found in the [package vignette for acquisition functions](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/acquisition_functions.html). 

```{r}
#| label: "search"
#| cache: false
set.seed(12)
search_res <-
  svm_wflow %>% 
  tune_bayes(
    resamples = folds,
    # To use non-default parameter ranges
    param_info = svm_set,
    # Generate five at semi-random to start
    initial = 5,
    iter = 50,
    # How to measure performance?
    metrics = metric_set(roc_auc),
    control = control_bayes(no_improve = 30, verbose = TRUE)
  )
```

The resulting tibble is a stacked set of rows of the rsample object with an additional column for the iteration number:

```{r}
#| label: "show-iters"
search_res
```

As with grid search, we can summarize the results over resamples:

```{r}
#| label: "summarize-iters"
estimates <- 
  collect_metrics(search_res) %>% 
  arrange(.iter)

estimates
```


The best performance of the initial set of candidate values was `AUC = `r max(estimates$mean[estimates$.iter == 0])` `. The best results were achieved at iteration `r estimates$.iter[which.max(estimates$mean)]` with a corresponding AUC value of `r max(estimates$mean)`. The five best results are:

```{r}
#| label: "best"
show_best(search_res, metric = "roc_auc")
```

A plot of the search iterations can be created via:

```{r}
#| label: "bo-plot"
autoplot(search_res, type = "performance")
```

There are many parameter combinations have roughly equivalent results. 

How did the parameters change over iterations? 


```{r}
#| label: "bo-param-plot"
#| fig-width:  9
autoplot(search_res, type = "parameters") + 
  labs(x = "Iterations", y = NULL)
```
