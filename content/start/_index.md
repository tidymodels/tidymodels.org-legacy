**Welcome!** Here, learn what you need to get started with tidymodels in five articles, starting with how to create a model and ending with a beginning-to-end modeling case study. After you are comfortable with these basics, you can [learn how go farther with tidymodels](/learn/).

If you are new to R or the tidyverse, there are many excellent resources for learning. We recommend:

* [learning resources from the education team at RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/)

* [tidyverse-specific resources from the tidyverse team](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/)
