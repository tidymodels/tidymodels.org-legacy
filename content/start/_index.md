Here, learn what you need to get started with tidymodels in five articles, starting with how to create a model and ending with a beginning-to-end modeling case study. After you are comfortable with these basics, you can [learn how to go farther with tidymodels](/learn/).

## If you are new to R or the tidyverse

To get the most out of tidymodels, we recommend that you start by learning some basics about R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) first, then return here when you feel ready. Here are some resources to start learning:

* [Finding Your Way To R](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/), from the RStudio Education team.

* [Learn the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/), from the tidyverse team.

* [Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse](/books/moderndive/).
